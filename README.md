French citizen residing in Quebec City, QC (Canada), I work for Red Hat in the OpenStack Engineering organization.

After spending 9 years making OpenStack deployments a better experience for both the community and Red Hat customers, I'm now working with both the OpenShift and OpenStack projects, to make sure they integrate well together.
